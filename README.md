Team 9 Project

Short description: Housing information system with a map view or list view and dorm information, pictures.

Design rationale for data schema: We want to store and display all information about dorms that would be
interesting to students, including the gender policy, room styles, availability, and floor plan.

Design rationale for list view: For students who have an idea of what kind of dorm they want to live in, 
the list view provides the ability to search for specific dorms or filter results according to categories
in the data schema. 

Design rationale for map view: For students who want to explore their options, the map view provides the
ability to see the locations of dorms relative to each other and buildings on campus, then click on dorms
on the map and see preliminary information about them.

Packages, APIs, and dependencies used:

Bootstrap 3 via django-bootstrap3
	All developer documentation for Bootstrap 3 is in different tabs here http://getbootstrap.com/
	Developer documentation for django-bootstrap3 is in the sidebar here 
	https://django-bootstrap3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

Django 3
	Developer information for Django 3 is here https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/


That's pretty much it - Django has a built-in database that we used and Bootstrap had all the basic styling tools that we needed
